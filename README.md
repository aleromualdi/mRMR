Information based feature selection algorithm based on the mutual information criteria of
max-relevance and min-redundancy presented by Peng et al. in by Peng et al.
in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1453511/. <br/>
<br/>
Because the algorithm makes use of information metric functions, such as Shanon Entropy, it requires discretized data.
